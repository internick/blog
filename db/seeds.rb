Plus it seemed to fit the whole old industrial loft motif.<p>I proceeded to spend my entire afternoon searching for metal signs on EBay.  I was pleasantly surprised by the number of old tin signs available.  Most of them were priced reasonably at around $8 to $10.

Tommy commented a couple times that I had a very athletic back, and that made Tristan laugh.  Anyway, Tristan approved of the suit, so I handed Tommy my credit card.  I walked out of that store the proud owner of a suit!<p>As for the semi-formal itself, Jill and I had a lot of fun.  We ate dinner with some other friends at a cute little country inn, and then proceeded to dance the night away!  A nice chance to test out those dance moves I\'ve been working on.

Fearing that the small feline may be in danger all alone like it was, Nicodemus took it up into his arms and vowed to protect the kitten with his very life if necessary!  So the travelers continued on with their newfound companion.<p>Amelia was very excited at their arrival.  The young men foolishly believed it was their presence that brought her joy.  It was actually the presence of the cute kitty cat.  Amelia was so excited that she stopped studying old people so she could play with the kitten.<p>The four of them played and laughed all evening!  Except for the kitten, who could not laugh.  As Antonio watched the furry creature bounce around, he exclaimed, "I think we should call her Jimmy!"  Nicodemus, Amelia, and even the cat looked puzzled by this and decided <b>Darla</b> would be a better name.  And so it was.<p>As the night wore on, the friends became tired, and they all decided to retire.  The question then arose, where would Darla sleep?  Amelia said her roommate Jaime (prounounced HI-MAY) was out of town and generously offered Darla her bed.  But Darla graciously refused, saying she cannot sleep alone.  So Nicodemus took Darla home with him.  Little did Amelia know, she would never again see her darling friend Darla.<p>Much could be written about the night that Darla spent at Nicodemus\' home, but it will suffice to say that this particular cat did not take even one cat nap all night.  And Nicodemus was frustrated by his guest\'s inconsiderate behavior--especially when she pounced on his face while he slept.  Not cool.<p>The following day, Darla apologized and Nicodemus forgave her.  (However, he secretly planned to wake her up whenever he caught her sleeping that day.)<p>At that moment, Antonio arrived with distressing news.  He said Darla\'s owner had posted "Missing Kitten" signs near his home.  Nicodemus did not know what to say.  Everything he held dear and depended on was about to be snatched away!  He looked over to Darla.  She was sleeping.  He let her sleep.<p>Nicodemus sat down by the tired cat.  He wanted to explain what was going to happen, but he knew she would not understand--who really does, he thought?  So he and Antonio took Darla back to her owner, said a quick farewell, and slowly walked away.<p>Antonio tried to comfort his friend, but Nicodemus silently turned to look back at Darla\'s home.  He sighed and turned to go.  As the old friends went, they plotted ways to get Darla back, but soon dismissed the ideas because they got hungry and went to look for something to eat.<div class="sslink"><a href="javascript:SlideShow(\'40,41,42,43,44\');">Slideshow: See Darla Play.</a></div>', :icon => '246', :created_at => '2003-04-04 17:25:56 +0000', :old_id => '54' },

You may feel as though the lack of posts here on my blog is indicative of a general failure as a person on my part, but you\'re just wrong.  Plus, that is a mean thing to think.  In fact, you should be ashamed of yourself.<p>Right, now that you\'ve seen the error of your ways, we can move on to the real topic of today\'s blog: <b>The Matrix Reloaded</b>.<p>Last week on opening night, I was one of the many thousands who crammed theaters to see the highly anticipated sequel.

Well, maybe not as excited as the fellow in the first row who sat down so quickly that he broke his chair and fell onto the floor...that was neat.<p>After leaving the theater, these were my reactions, in no particular order:<ul><li><b>Raving Lunatics</b><br>My primary complaint about the movie was the 20 minute tribal "rave" scene which was interrupted only for the occasional peak at Neo and Trinity getting better acquainted.  This scene was entirely unnecessary and cheapened the movie--100% trash.<p><li><b>Lights, Camera, and above all, ACTION</b><br>Never before in my life have I seen action as amazing as in this movie.  The fights and stunts and special effects were breathtaking!  Quite often I found myself literally on the edge of my seat and all tensed up, completely enthralled by the action.<p><li><b>How Deep is the Rabbit Hole?</b><br>Yeah, so the story got a lot more complicated.  And the Architect used a lot of big words.  Yeah.  And the end only leaves more questions.  Okay, so I\'m a little confused about what the heck is going on in the story, but it\'s okay because the final installment of the trilogy comes out in only 6 months.<p></ul>Those are my initial thoughts and reactions.

And every day since, I have thanked God for bringing me a girl more beautiful, more fun, and more amazing than I ever expected.<p><b>Fun In The Sun</b><br>Right after spring finals, I flew home to join my family on a trip to the sunny beaches of Charleston, SC.  In tribute to the valiant people of Rohan, we built not a sand castle, but a sand <i>Helm\'s Deep</i>.  The clear skies led to a few sunburns (poor Ben), but also made for some spectacular star-gazing.<p><b>Summer School</b><br>I am actually surprised how little I complained about taking 12 hours of class this summer.  It got a little repetitive with each class 5 days a week, but my roommates were in the same boat...so it\'s all good. (You get a point if you know that last reference.)<p><b>4th of July</b><br>To celebrate our day of independence, me and the gang journeyed to Austin where we did some <a href="javascript:PicView(\'79\');">tubular tubing</a>, ate some snowy snow-cones, and watched the fiery fireworks!<p><b>Pinball</b><br>I want to get this out in the open: I, Nicholas Patrick Cochran, am <a href="javascript:PicView(\'80\');">addicted</a> to the Addam\'s Family pinball machine.

At least in the eyes and heart of this young man.<p>As most of you know, for the past six months I have been dating a lovely girl named Jaime Patterson.  Even before our first date, I knew in my heart that I was going to marry her someday.  Well folks, <b>someday</b> is now an official date on my calendar!<p>And for those of you that don\'t understand the significance of that statement (probably my male demographic): <b>I\'M ENGAGED</b>!<p>I know it is probably hard for you to believe, and you must have many questions.  How could your friendly little blogger be growing up so fast?  How did he propose?  When is the wedding?  Can I see the ring?  How many feet are there in a nautical mile?  Well I don\'t have the answers to all of those questions, but I will tell you about...<p><b>The Proposal</b><p>The main thing preventing me from getting engaged all along was an uncertainty about where I would be living and working after college.  I wanted to have the security of knowing I had a job and an income lined up before I committed to getting married.<p>God certainly provided in ways I could not even expect, because I was offered a wonderful job with <a href="http://www.exxonmobil.com" target="_blank">ExxonMobil</a> and accepted their offer Monday before Thanksgiving.  I had always <i>hoped</i> that I would know about a job by Thanksgiving because all my family was planning to fly down for the holidays to spend the week in The Woodlands.  My moment of opportunity had arrived!<p>So on Monday I drove to Dallas and bought a beautiful (if I may say so) engagement ring and on Tuesday I drove to Houston and secretly met with Jaime\'s parents.  In the meantime, I had also reserved the Woodlands Ice Rink for Thanksgiving night, where I intended to propose.<p>The whole week I was incredibly nervous and incredibly excited at the same time.  My heart and my brain were both going about a million miles per hour.  By the grace of God, the secret was preserved even when Jaime visited my relatives\' house on Wednesday night.  I was so relieved and happy when she finally left!<p>Keep in mind that Jaime was not expecting a proposal until March or April next year, so I had the opportunity to completely catch her off guard.  I had my friend Anthony call and pretend to ask if we wanted to join him and some friends at the skating rink.  So we drove up there around 9:30 Thanksgiving night.<p>When we arrived, the rink was illuminated by thousands of Christmas lights as Edwin McCain\'s <i>I\'ll Be</i> was playing on the sound system (I made a <a href="javascript:alert(\'The Proposal Soundtrack\\n\\n  1. Stephen Speaks - Passenger Seat\\n  2. Edwin McCain - I\\\'ll Be\\n  3. Pete Yorn - Girl Like You\\n  4. Stephen Speaks - Out of My League      \\n  5. Chicago - Just You \\\'n\\\' Me\\n  6. Debussy - Clair De Lune\\n\');">CD with our favorite songs</a>).  My aunt and cousin helped me set up a table just inside the door with roses, flower petals, candles, and two pairs of ice skates.<p>At this point, Jaime was still clueless.  As she later said, "I just thought the rink had a nice table decoration!"  She thought the rink was closed and we shouldn\'t be there, but I convinced her to put on her skates and we started cautiously skating around the rink.<p>I couldn\'t wait more than about 3 laps before I stopped her, because at this point she was getting suspicious.  I was too nervous to really remember what I intended to say to her, but I did say some nice things.  Then I got down on a knee (which isn\'t easy on ice skates) and asked her to marry me!  As soon as I opened the ring box, she reached down, took the ring, and put it on her finger.  I took that as a yes, but then she did reaffirm her answer with an emphatic "Yes!"<p>After we skated for about 20 more minutes, we went back to her house where both our families were waiting to celebrate!  I don\'t think I stopped smiling all night, and the next day my face muscles were sore!<p>It was a perfect night and I am so happy, so relieved, and so very blessed!  But this is only the beginning.  I know God has many great things planned for our life ahead together.<p>I\'m sure the days ahead won\'t always be this euphoric, but when facing life\'s trials and adventures, there is no one who I\'d rather have by my side than her.
